Ruby – Diet Manager

Name: Meet Patel

================================================================
Level 1 – Food DB Load – Start
Estimated Time	1H MM
Plan for this level:
	For this part, I will just create a hashmap of Food and Recipes, 
with thier name mapping to the actual objects. I will also create classes
for Food and Recipe and give them a toString method

Level 1 – Food DB Load – Complete
Actual Time	1H MM
Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.
	I encountered a couple of problems when I called methods on
objects when hashing because I wasnt aware of what object they were 
due the Ruby bieng a dynamic language. 

================================================================
Level 2 – Print & Find – Start
Estimated Time	 15 min
Plan for this level:
	For this part, I will use the starts with method for strings
to find the key witht he given prefix, and finding the value using 
a key for the print method.

Level 2  – Print & Find – Complete
Actual Time	15 min
Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.
	This part was pretty simple, I didnt need to do much and 
everything went as planned fortunetly. T
================================================================
Level 3 – Database Update – Start
Estimated Time	1H MM
Plan for this level:
	I think Ill just have to create new food or recipe objects
and put them into my database after checking if they arent already
in them. Also, Im confused about what quit does

Level 3 – Database Update  – Complete
Actual Time	1H MM
Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.
I basically just created new food or recipe objects and updated my
hashmap. I still was confused as to what quit does so I skipped it 
for now. 
================================================================
Level 4 – Logging Foods – Start
Estimated Time	HH 45
Plan for this level:
	Ill start with show all so I can use it to check if my hashmap
updates in order to check the other commants. Also the 2 log functions
look pretty similar so they wont be hard.
Level 4 – Logging Foods – Complete
Actual Time	HH 50
Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.
	It was cool learning how you can show what time is it in 
real life using Ruby, because I felt that that shows how this code
can be actually useful in real life if you are dieting or creating
a fitness app. 
================================================================
Level 5 – Show & Delete – Start
Estimated Time	 45m
Plan for this level:
	For this ill just remove the given string from the LogItems
foodList, and show the information from the foodlists from the given
date. 
Level 5 – Show & Delete – Complete
Actual Time	1 30
Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.
	I had problems because I got a lot of null pointer exceptions
type things which took a lot of time to debug. Also, I had a problem
where there was an extra \n charector that I couldnt even see. This made
me take twice the time as I expected.
================================================================
Overall Summary
Estimated Total Time	3H 0M
Actual Total Time	3H 45
Project reflection:

	For this project, I had a lot of difficulties because ruby is a 
dyamically typed language and a lot of times, the object that I expected
something to be wasnt the object that it actually was. Also, It was
 cool learning how you can show what time is it in
real life using Ruby, because I felt that that shows how this code
can be actually useful in real life if you are dieting or creating
a fitness app. In addition, I felt that this was a very nice project
which was pretty fair because all of the problems that I encountered
were very relevent to learning the language, and although it was thought
provoking, it wasnt too long and dragged out.
